## Cost Based Pricing

Cost Based Pricing is a pricing methodology of applying certain percentage(s) ontop of the unit cost of a product or category. Often it is quite simple to achieve and hence due to this reason perhaps the most prevalent form of pricing for MSMEs, typically driven from finance or accounting departments stating ROI or inflation indexing requirements. However, in more complex business setups subject to various dynamic forces such as cost allocations, demand shifts, contract negotiations and competitive landscapes the consequences of not getting the adequate cost plus strategy (i.e., percentage(s) timing and integration) right can be difficult to discern and far reaching without having the necessary expertise and in dealing with commercial outcomes of such actions.

## Competitor Based Pricing

Competitor Based Pricing is a pricing methodology of identifying a set of competitors and setting a prices using indices of where the business thinks its products or service offerings sits along that competitor range of products and services. This approach needs to consider how closely or far away matched the competitors' business in terms of set-up, operational capabilities and market proposition is to its own. Further, businesses need to consider if the product range or services being indexed are like-for-like or similar but variant on certain dimensions and what impact this may have on its price indexation of the competitor range. The business does not need to be price lower or higher but mantain the index profile for its range or categories which is maximising its need for top line and bottom line and further drive indexation for categories or range as and when required. This approach is often driven by marketing and product teams who develop market propositions of where products sit within the competitor range in the market.

## Inventory Based Pricing

Inventory Based Pricing is a pricing methodology of pricing products on the basis of current inventory levels, sales and depletion rates and inbound inventory dates and amounts. It works by rotating stock in the warehouse and effectively clearing slow moving stock, slow down fast moving stock and generate greater more gross margin and cashflow compensation for any '*out of stock*' scenarios. It works by pricing up products that are fast selling and likely to become out of stock before the next container which may be arriving after stock out period of that product arrives. *Vice versa* if a product is slow selling that product's price is reduced to induce a faster sales rates and depletion rate to move stock before the next container of that stock which may be arriving relatively soon. This methodology is often used by start ups to generate cashflows, penetrate the market and manage warehousing and supplier payments within their means.

## Surge Based Pricing

Surge Based Pricing is a pricing methodology of measuring or predicting demand (similar to Inventory Based Pricing, however, inventory levels not an essential prerequisite) and pricing on premium based on demand levels. The business can mantain or even reduce is stock levels for the periods where demand is the highest or relatively higher and rely on pricing power to generate incremental revenue and gross margins. Often this pricing methodology is seen in service industries such as ride share applicaiton fares, airline fares, holiday and cruise fares, concert and sports event ticketing. There is a sophisticated but rational element of the product or service being required for that period, usually based on demand and availability for the period of time and region, where the purchaser may not be able to receive the same service again for that same period of time and region hence a premium is applied.
