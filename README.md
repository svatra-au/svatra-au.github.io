## Cost Based Pricing

Cost Based Pricing is a pricing methodology of applying certain percentage(s) ontop of the unit cost of the product or category. Often it is quite simple to achieve and perhaps the most prevalent form of pricing due to the simplistic and being an easy to grasp concept for most businesses, typically driven from finance departements with ROI or Inflation indexing requirements. However, in more complex business setups subject to dynamic forces such as cost allocations, demand shifts and competitive landscapes the adequate amount or consequential percentage(s) can be difficult to discern without some knowledge or background into commercial dependencies of such actions.
