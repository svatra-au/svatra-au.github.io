## Cost Based Pricing

Cost Based Pricing is a pricing methodology of applying certain percentage(s) ontop of the unit cost of a product or category. Often it is quite simple to achieve and perhaps the most prevalent form of pricing due to the simplistic application and easy to grasp concept for most businesses, typically driven from finance departments with ROI or inflation indexing requirements. However, in more complex business setups subjected to various dynamic forces such as cost allocations, demand shifts, contract negotiations and competitive landscapes the adequate cost plus spread and consequences can be difficult to discern without having expertise in commercial outcomes of such actions.
